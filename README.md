# Supercabs 

The purpose of this project is to create a reinforcement learning agent that helps an imaginary cab company named Supercabs to maximize profit for their cab drivers.

# Hypothetical Problem statement
Each cab drivers get cab request. Each cab request is for a ride to a given location. In order to maximize the overall profit, cab driver must select the right request. As an example, A cab driver might get two requests. One taking him to along distance ride, and another to take to nearby airport. While first might give a higher fare and hence higher profit, the second ride could be more profitable due to increased chances of getting more profitable ride from the airport.
